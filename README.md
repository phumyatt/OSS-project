Space Shooter Game

Space Shooter is an exciting 2D arcade-style space shooter game built using Pygame. In this game, you control a spaceship to defeat waves of alien enemies, avoid obstacles, and collect points. The game features intuitive controls, fast-paced gameplay, and increasing difficulty as you progress through levels.

Features

Player Movement: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship and avoid enemy collisions.
Laser Shooting: Press and hold the spacebar to shoot lasers at enemy spaceships.
Enemy Waves: Random enemies spawn at the top of the screen and move downward. Destroy them to increase your score.
Score System: Score points by destroying enemies. The score increases as you defeat more enemies.
Lives and Game Over: You start with 3 lives. Lose all lives, and the game is over. A "Game Over" screen gives you the option to restart or quit.
Level Progression: As you score points, the game progresses to higher levels with increased difficulty (faster enemies, more frequent enemy spawns).
Sound Effects: Includes background music and sound effects for shooting and explosions to enhance gameplay experience.
Game Restart/Exit: After a game over, press 'R' to restart or 'Q' to quit the game.
